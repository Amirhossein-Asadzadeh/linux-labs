# Linux Labs

Hands-on Linux practice for my DevOps & Cloud Engineering journey.

This repository includes small, focused labs designed to build a strong
foundation in: - Linux administration - System services & processes -
Users, permissions & security basics - Networking fundamentals - Bash
scripting & automation

More labs will be added every week as I progress.
